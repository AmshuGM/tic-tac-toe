# Tic Tac Toe Game with Minimax Algorithm

![Tic Tac Toe]

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where you've incorporated the Minimax algorithm to provide an AI opponent that plays optimally.

Play the game: [Tic Tac Toe Game](https://amshustictacoe.netlify.app/)

## Features

- Play against an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface.
- Keeps track of the game state, player's turn, and winner.
- Supports restarting the game after completion.

## How to Play

1. Access the game through the provided link: [Tic Tac Toe Game](https://amshustictacoe.netlify.app/)
2. The game starts with a blank 3x3 grid.
3. You are "Player X," and you'll take the first turn.
4. Click on an empty cell to place your "X" mark.
5. The AI opponent ("Player O") will then make its move using the Minimax algorithm.
6. Continue taking turns until either a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
7. If you win, celebrate your victory! If the AI wins, don't worry, it's tough to beat.
8. You can restart the game at any time to play again.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end interface.
- Minimax algorithm for creating the AI opponent.
- Hosting and deployment on Netlify.
